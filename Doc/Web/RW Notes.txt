@section 	Notes
	a real emphasis on re-thinking code architecture in Swift
		heavy preference of value types over reference types
	quick-and-dirty:
		value types keep a unique copy of their data			(Multi)
		reference types share a single copy of their data		(Single!)
	Comparison:
		Tradtnl: use references to objects
		Swift: uses classes which are implemented using reference semantics
